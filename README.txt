Introduction
============

Implements a placeful workflow policy needed for the GroupSpace content type
of collective.groupspace.content that makes sure that, unless otherwise 
defined, all content types use the default workflow as defined by the 
placeful workflow policy.

This package is part of the collective.groupspace suite, whose components should
be installed as needed:

* collective.groupspace.content

* collective.groupspace.roles

* collective.groupspace.mail
